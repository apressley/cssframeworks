# CSS Frameworks from Ashley's POV

## Lightweights

### [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/)
#### Pros
* Lightweight
* More extensive grid system than others, and customizable beyond that
* Modular, if we don't want "all the stuff"
* Can be combined easily with other things

#### Cons
* I find the naming kind of silly, "pure-" everything
* Nothing unique or special

---

## Middleweights

### [GroundworkCSS](http://groundworkcss.github.io/groundwork/?url=docs/home)
#### Pros
* More lightweight than others
* Clean and simple
* I like the simplicity of the grid system
* Good naming conventions
* Pro SASS

#### Cons
* No longer updated (it seems), but that isn't a bad thing for something simple
* CSS & JS, not modular
* Not the most documentation, but enough

## Heavyweights

### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
#### Pros
* Strong familiarity
* Pro-SASS
* Great documentation & v4.0 released
* Pre-included JS means less for us to build, potentially

#### Cons
* Probably too many extras for what we will need (bloated)
* CSS & JS, not modular


### [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)
#### Pros
* More options than Bootstrap and...
* Lighter than Bootstrap, but still heavyweight
* Pro-SASS
* Pre-included JS means less for us to build, potentially

#### Cons
* CSS & JS
* Not as, but still a bit bloated
